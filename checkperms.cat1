DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The cchheecckkppeerrmmss command reads a list of files from _s_t_d_i_n and checks for
     each line whether the file permissions of that file are reasonable or
     not.

     --cc        Check the contents of executable files to have a known format.
               For example, Perl modules don't need to be executable at all.
               Currently, ELF and #! are recognized.

     --ee        Treat any warnings as errors, that is, exit with a non-zero
               exit status.

     --ff        When given once, errors are fixed automatically.  When given
               twice, most of the warnings are fixed, too.

     --nn        When given once, shows what would be fixed for --ff.  When given
               twice, shows what would be fixed for --ffff.

     --qq        When this option is given, the summary line about the number of
               errors and warnings is not printed as the last line.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     Zero when no errors occured, non-zero otherwise.  Warnings don't affect
     the exit status, unless the --ee option is given.

     ··   There may be race conditions between reading the file permissions and
         writing the fixed ones.

     ··   When directories are moved during a run of this program, permissions
         may be changed on foreign files.  However, this requires good timing
         from the side of the attacker.
